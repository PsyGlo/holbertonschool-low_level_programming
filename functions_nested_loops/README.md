Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains C programming exercises focused on mastering functions and nested loops. These fundamental programming concepts enable modular, reusable code and the ability to perform repeated actions within repeated actions, essential for solving complex problems.

Through these projects, I have learnt to write well-structured functions following Holberton's coding standards and apply nested loops for tasks such as printing patterns, manipulating characters, and performing iterative computations. This forms the foundation for more advanced topics in C programming and systems development.

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
