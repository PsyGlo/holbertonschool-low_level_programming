Variables, If/Else, and While Loops

This directory contains introductory C programming exercises centered on variables, decision-making using if/else, and creating loops using the while statement. These are fundamental programming tools that enable dynamic program flow, branching logic, and iterative computations.

Through these exercises, I have learnt to declare and manipulate variables, use conditional statements for controlling execution, and leverage loops to efficiently repeat tasks. These core skills provide the backbone for building more complex programs and algorithms.


Files and Descriptions

Each program is written in ANSI C (GNU89 standard) and follows the Betty coding style guidelines.


0-positive_or_negative.c: A C program that uses rand() to generate a random number, assigns it to variable n after shifting by RAND_MAX / 2, and prints whether n is positive, negative, or zero, followed by a newline.

1-last_digit.c: A program that generates a random number and prints its last digit, followed by a message stating whether it is greater than 5, less than 6, or equal to 0.

2-print_alphabet.c: Prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.

3-print_alphabets.c: Prints both lowercase and uppercase alphabets.

4-print_alphabt.c: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, but omits the letters q and e.

5-print_numbers.c: Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using a while loop.

6-print_numberz.c: Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using the _putchar function.

7-print_tebahpla.c: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

8-print_base16.c: Prints all possible digits of base 16 in lowercase.

9-print_comb.c: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas.
