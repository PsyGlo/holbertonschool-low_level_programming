More Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains C programming exercises designed to deepen understanding of functions and nested loops. Building on the foundation established in the previous "functions_nested_loops" project, these tasks focus on writing modular functions and applying nested loops to solve more complex problems such as pattern printing, number manipulation, and control flow in algorithms.

Through these exercises, I enhanced my ability to write clean, reusable function code and efficiently use nested loops to manage repeated tasks within repeated tasks. Topics covered include character checks, arithmetic operations, printing sequences and shapes, and implementing classic programming exercises like FizzBuzz.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, one is expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
