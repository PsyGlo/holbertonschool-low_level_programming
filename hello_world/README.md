Hello, World

This directory contains foundational C programming exercises centered on understanding the compilation process and basic output functions like putchar and printf. These projects introduce important concepts including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking C programs. This has helped me to gain a clear understanding of how source code translates into executable programs.

Through these exercises, I learnt to write simple programs that print text to the terminal, I familiarised myself with the compilation workflow, and practiced using standard output functions efficiently and correctly.
